# swagger-speccer
An SBT plugin that generates Play2 routes files from Swagger 2.0 specifications.

Disclaimer: the current state of the plugin is heavily untested and with a lot of the possible swagger-to-play mappings missing.  We thought we should get some release out though, so we can get some feedback.
